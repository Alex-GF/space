/**
 * Applying expected consumption to usage limits.
 *
 * Read-modify-write loses consumptions in two ways. Applying the limits of one
 * evaluation in turn made each application read the whole contract, change one
 * usage level in its own copy and write the whole contract back, so an
 * evaluation touching two limits recorded one of them. Batching them into a
 * single read and write fixed that, and left the other: two requests arriving
 * together both read the same consumed value, both write the same total, and
 * one consumption disappears.
 *
 * The increment is now handed to the database as `$inc`, which is the only
 * place it can be settled.
 *
 * These tests work against a stubbed repository and cache so they can assert on
 * the reads and writes themselves, which is where the defect lived. The stub
 * models the database honestly: `incrementUsageLevels` adds to whatever is
 * *stored* at the moment it runs, which is exactly the guarantee `$inc` gives
 * and exactly the one an application-side read-modify-write cannot.
